# PureGerber
Processing Gerber data in PureBasic

This project aims to process Gerber data (stored in Gerber files) in PureBasic.
Therefor it offers a parser, which processes ther Gerber files.
It also has its own, proprietary Gerber format which is processed much faster.
It is still in development and some Gerber features are still missing.

Done:
- Basic Gerber rendering
- BlockMode
- Filled and Skeleton view
- Own, optimized Gerber format (PureGerber, *.pgr)
- Export to SVG

Missing/WIP:
- StepMode
- Variables
- Procesing of Metadata (attributes...)
