Processing Gerber data in PureBasic

This project aims to process Gerber data (stored in Gerber files) in PureBasic.
Therefor it offers a parser, which processes ther Gerber files.
It also has its own, proprietary Gerber format which is processed much faster.
It is still in development and some Gerber features are still missing.
